# Project Proposal: Sold - AI-Powered Multi-Platform Marketplace App

## Executive Summary

**Sold** is a mobile application that revolutionizes online selling by automating the entire listing and buyer coordination process across multiple marketplace platforms. Users simply take a photo of an item, and our AI handles pricing, listing creation, cross-platform posting, buyer communication, and pickup scheduling.

### Problem Statement
Selling items online is time-consuming and fragmented:
- Sellers must manually create listings on multiple platforms (Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, OfferUp, etc.)
- Each platform requires separate accounts, photos, descriptions, and pricing
- Responding to buyer inquiries is repetitive and time-intensive
- Coordinating pickups involves back-and-forth messaging across platforms

### Solution
Sold automates the entire selling workflow:
1. **Photo → AI Analysis**: Take a photo, AI identifies item and suggests prices
2. **One-Click Publishing**: Simultaneously post to all major marketplaces
3. **AI Buyer Agent**: GPT-4 powered agent negotiates prices and coordinates pickups
4. **Calendar Integration**: Automatic scheduling with Google Calendar
5. **Payment Facilitation**: Display Venmo/Zelle for seamless payments

## Risk Analysis & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk**: Facebook Marketplace API limitations
- **Mitigation**: Use Graph API where available, Puppeteer automation as fallback, manual posting MVP

**Risk**: AI pricing accuracy
- **Mitigation**: Train on historical data, allow user override, continuous model improvement

**Risk**: Platform API changes breaking integrations
- **Mitigation**: Error handling, graceful degradation, monitoring/alerts, quick patch releases

### Business Risks

**Risk**: Low user adoption
- **Mitigation**: Free trial period, referral incentives, ASO optimization, targeted ads

**Risk**: High AI API costs
- **Mitigation**: Implement caching, optimize prompts, negotiate OpenAI enterprise pricing

**Risk**: App Store rejection
- **Mitigation**: Follow guidelines strictly, clear privacy policy, manual review preparation

### Legal Risks

**Risk**: Platform ToS violations (automation)
- **Mitigation**: Legal review, user-initiated actions, rate limiting, human-in-the-loop option

**Risk**: Payment processing regulations
- **Mitigation**: Stripe compliance, proper tax handling, Terms of Service
