## üéØ How Our App Meets Academic Goals

### Software Engineering Principles Demonstrated

1. **Requirements Engineering**
   - User stories from stakeholder perspective
   - Functional & non-functional requirements
   - Use case modeling

2. **Agile Methodology**
   - 3 iterations (sprints)
   - Incremental delivery
   - Continuous feedback & adaptation

3. **Architecture & Design**
   - Monorepo structure (backend/mobile/shared)
   - REST API design
   - Database normalization
   - Component-based UI

4. **Testing & Quality**
   - Test-Driven Development (TDD)
   - Unit tests (Jest)
   - Integration tests (Supertest)
   - 80%+ code coverage

5. **Version Control & Collaboration**
   - Git workflow with feature branches
   - Pull request reviews
   - Trunk-based development
   - Commit message standards

6. **DevOps & Deployment**
   - CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
   - Cloud deployment (AWS/Heroku)
   - Automated testing in CI
   - Database migrations

7. **Third-Party Integrations**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issues & Mitigations

### Issue 1: AI/ML Restriction
**Problem**: Project uses OpenAI AI services, document says "NO AI"
**Mitigation**:
- OpenAI is a third-party API, not ML development
- Will document as external service with instructor approval
- Team is not training models or doing data mining
- **Action**: Confirm with instructor that API usage is acceptable

### Issue 2: Team Size (6 vs 3-5)
**Problem**: Proposed 6-person team, requirement is 3-5
**Mitigation**:
- Can adjust to 5 people
- Or get instructor approval for 6
- **Action**: Confirm team size with instructor

### Issue 3: External Libraries
**Problem**: Using React Native, Express, many npm packages
**Mitigation**:
- Document ALL external dependencies
- Only use standard, approved libraries
- All business logic written by team
- **Action**: Maintain dependencies.md file

### Issue 4: Platform API Automation
**Problem**: Automating posts to Facebook/Craigslist may violate ToS
**Mitigation**:
- Legal review of platform policies
- Implement manual fallback options
- User-initiated actions only
- **Action**: Research each platform's developer policies
